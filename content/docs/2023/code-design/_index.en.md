# 2023 Tokyo University of the Arts Art media Center「Code and Design」

（Spring-Summer　Friday 4・5）


Lecturer:[Matsuura Tomoya ](https://matsuuratomoya.com/en)

Room: Art Media Center(Factory Complex A 2F) Classroom 1,2

## Class Summary

In this class, students will learn basic knowledge for creating and designing artworks that use computers independently, with practical application. In particular, students will learn how to handle hardware and interfaces such as LEDs and switches through electronic construction and programming.

The first half of the class aims to understand the components of a computer, such as algorithms, protocols, and logic, through workshops and simple electronics work without using a computer.

In the second half of the course, students will use Arduino, an environment that easily connects electronics and programming, and digital fabrication equipment such as laser cutters and 3D printers to understand more practical interaction and control methods, and to be able to incorporate them into their own creations. The course is designed to enable students to understand and incorporate more practical interaction and control methods into their own production.

*Due to the equipment in AMC, the number of students will be limited to a maximum of 20. The number of students may be further limited depending on the infection situation.

## Purpose and Goal of the Class	

The goal of this class is for students to be able to use computers not as a black box but as a tool for production through electronic fabrication and programming.

In addition, by learning how to convert data and materials into each other through the operation of digital fabrication equipment, students will gain a deep understanding of the structure of data and information that underlies production.

## Required Preparation for the Class

At the end of each lecture, the contents of the preparation for the next lecture will be presented.
The materials for each lecture will be posted on the website so that students can review them on their own as necessary.

## Grading

Grades will be graded as follows: 30% for attendance, 30% for small assignments presented several times during the class, and 40% for assignments.
Attendance points will be counted by submitting your comments and questions on the Google Form at the end of each class.

For the short assignment, you will submit the work you have done in class as it is in data format or as a document including photos, videos, etc. in physical format via Google Classroom.

The final assignment will be one of the following, which must be submitted by the end of the 14th class session by installing the exhibit in the AMC Lab.
- A brushed-up version of the small assignment created in class
- A free work (a work that reflects the knowledge gained in the class on your own work)
Both individual and group work is acceptable for the assignment.

The grade for the final assignment will be based on what the student intended to produce rather than on the degree of completion.

Unsubmitted work will receive 0 points, and work submitted after the due date will receive a reduction in points.

## Messeges for the Participants

The class will be basically done in Japanese. However, the teacher can help and answer to individual question in English. If you are worrying whether you should take the class or not, do not hesitate contact to the teacher to ask about it (teach[at]matsuuratomoya.com).

Today, whether creating video or music, it is no longer easy to complete a production without the use of a computer. However, the world of computers is not inherently closed to mice, keyboards, and displays. If we can handle various inputs and outputs such as light, motors, and switches through electronic construction, or if we can use digital fabrication equipment to convert data and materials into each other, we can play with various elements of the real world. Through these practices, you will be able to use technology proactively while increasing your range of expression.

### Required prior knowledge and expected class participation

No prior experience with electronics or programming is required. Those with experience are expected to actively support beginners.

In class, we will be handling equipment such as soldering irons and laser cutters, which can lead to serious problems such as injury or fire if used incorrectly. Please listen carefully to the instructions and concentrate on safety measures, including clothing and hair.

### About the equipment

#### Hardware

Basically, AMC will provide materials and tools related to electronics.

However, since some tools such as soldering irons are not that high quality, you can bring your own if you have the better one.

In addition, for the final project, students should bring materials like paper, wood and electronic components, by their own in principle.

#### Software

Basically, you will use the computer provided in the AMC lab, Mac mini (M1, Late 2020).
The following software is likely to be used at this time.

Arduino IDE v2.0.3 (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
Processing v4.2 (https://processing.org/download)
Adobe Illustrator 2022-10, v27 (https://helpx.adobe.com/jp/illustrator/system-requirements.html)
Adobe can be used on the AMC lab machines by logging in with your Geidai account.

You may bring your own laptop to work on. However, please be aware that we may not be able to immediately respond to differences in behavior or bugs that may occur due to non-macOS operating systems, different OS versions, or different hardware.

The computers in the lab will erase data when they are shut down, so please save your work data to a USB memory stick or similar device as appropriate.

### Communication Tools

All communication regarding class cancellations, reference materials, and assignment data will be conducted via Google Classroom. Please be sure to register by the second week before your course registration is confirmed.
